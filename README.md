# Tic Tac Toe Game
In this game, two players can play at a time. Player 1's mark is the cross 'x' and Player 2's mark is circle/dot 'o'. There are turns at first Player 1 has to choose the row and column where he/she wants his mark i.e. cross 'x', and then the Player 2's turn now he has to choose the row and column for his circle/dot 'o', then again Player 1's turn and then again Player 2's turn and so on.
That Player will win the game who first make his three continues mark (i.e. 'x' or 'o') either in a row or in a column or diagonally down or up. 
Hope you will Enjoy the game :)
